        "This visualization presents heatmaps showing the distribution of suicides across different **age groups**, **years**, and **genders**, from **1985 to 2020**. You can toggle between **raw counts** and **normalized rates**, as well as view data separately for **males and females**.\n",
        "\n",
        "When viewing the normalized mode, values are adjusted to show the **proportional share** of suicides for each age group **within a given year and gender** — this removes distortions caused by years or genders with more or less data.\n",

        "\n",
        "### What These Visualizations Tell Us\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Darker shades** represent a **higher share of suicides** for that age group in a specific year and gender.\n",
        "- The **35–54 years** age group consistently accounts for the **highest proportion** of suicides in most years for both males and females.\n",
        "- The **5–14 years** group remains consistently light, indicating a **very low share** of suicide cases.\n",
        "- The year **2016** appears unusually pale across all groups — this is due to **very few data entries**, making normalization essential for accurate comparison.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Normalize the Data?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Normalization **removes the effect of uneven data volume** across years and genders, especially for outliers like **2016**, which is underrepresented.\n",
        "- Without normalization, some years may falsely appear to have fewer suicides simply due to **limited records**.\n",
        "- It enables **fair comparison** of age-group suicide patterns **year by year**, and now, across **genders** as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights\n",
        "\n",
        "####  Male:\n",
        "- **Middle-aged males (35–54 years)** consistently represent the **largest share** of suicides.\n",
        "- **Older males (55–74 and 75+ years)** show an increasing trend over time, especially post-2000.\n",
        "- **Younger males (15–24 years)** have a moderate but steady share, highlighting an area of concern.\n",
        "\n",
        "####  Female:\n",
        "- The **35–54 years** group is again dominant, but the distribution across age groups is **more balanced** than for males.\n",
        "- **Females aged 25–34** make up a larger portion relative to their male counterparts.\n",
        "- **Older females (55+)** show a slow but steady increase in share over the years.\n",
